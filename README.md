## 🚀 what it do?

brotatdao has a homepage, upload page and explorer page.  The homepage just has information on how to use the service.  The upload page allows a user to connect an EVM wallet like metamask, then it allows the user to select an NFT from their wallet where they can then upload a profile page for the NFT they select.  This profile page is uploaded to IPFS using fleek.xyz and an ENS subdomain is set to route the subdomain to the IPFS address displaying the NFT profile page.  The user has the option for a free or paid subdomain.  The paid subdomain registers a subdomain using a set of contracts that gets deployed from this app using hardhat.  It then is then an ERC 1155 ENS nft like all current ENS names.  The explorer is where users can look at all the profiles that have been uploaded using the website.  It pulls information from the database and displays all the profile’s.

React project with vite + hardhat + firebase/firestore

## ⚡ How to deploy to Fleek

### 1. Create a `fleek.json` config file:
You can configure this site deployment using [Fleek CLI]() and running:
```
 > fleek sites init
   WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta phase, use it under your own responsibility
   ? Choose one of the existing sites or create a new one. › 
   ❯ Create a new site
```
It will prompt you for a `name`, `dist` directory location & `build command`
- `name`: How you want to name the site
- `dist`: The output directory where the site is located, for this template it's `dist`
- `build command`: Command to build your site, this will be used to deploy the latest version either by CLI or Github Actions

### 2. Deploy the site
After configuiring your `fleek.json` file, you can deploy the site by running

```
fleek sites deploy
```
After running it you will get an output like this:
```
 WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta, use it at your own discretion
 > Success! Deployed!
 > Site IPFS CID: QmP1nDyoHqSrRabwUSrxRV3DJqiKH7b9t1tpLcr1NTkm1M

 > You can visit through the gateway:
 > https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP1nDyoHqSrRabwUSrxRV3DJqiKH7b9t1tpLcr1NTkm1M
 ```

### Extra features
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** `fleek sites ci` [Documentation.](https://docs.fleek.xyz/services/sites/#continuous-integration-ci)
- **Adding custom domains:** `fleek domains create` [Documentation.](https://docs.fleek.xyz/services/domains/)


### Keep in mind:

This template has been configured to produce a static output.

```js
// vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: "./",
})
```

This means that assets will be pre-fixed with `./`, you can learn more about it in [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#base)
